LODI Wi-Fi HotSpot OpenWRT Configuration 
Version v1.0


This file is part of the OpenWRT configuration file set for a factory default LODI Wi-Fi HotSpot.
The fileset is packaged as a gzip compressed tar archive, and includes files for the directories: 
/root, /etc and /usr. 

A LODI Wi-Fi HotSpot requires installing the following packages:

○ coova-chilli
○ mwan3
○ openvpn-openssl
○ rsync 
○ sqm-scripts
○ wpad
○ zone-info-full

Registered hotspots will also required
○ ser2net
○ zabbix-agentd
○ zabbix-extra-mac80211
○ zabbix-extra-network
○ zabbix-extra-wifi

The easiest way to install the fileset is to copy the archive to the hotspot and use the following
commands:

	cd /
	tar -xzvf <directory-of-archive>/openwrt-config-v1p0.tar.gz
	reboot

Please note that generally if you do not intend to use your hotspot commercially, which requires relingquishing 
administrative control, you should not install the following files: /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and 
/etc/dropbear/authorized_keys. The hotspot should continue functioning with the default settings 
and functionality, including accessing our servers and retreiving updates. Additionally, you will
need to modify the file /root/directive.sh, which executes directives from our servers, as well as, 
checks for and pulls updates.
